# libtecla
A fork of the _libtecla_ command-line editing library written by Martin Shepherd

This repo is a fork of the (still useful) _libtecla_ command-line editing library written by Martin Shepherd at CalTech. I use _libtecla_ as an alternative to GNU Readline, thereby avoiding GPL contamination. Having the source as a git repo allows me to place minor compatibility fixes under version control (and perhaps these updates will be useful to others).

I have retained the original license from the [official download site](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~mcs/tecla/); see [LICENSE.TERMS](LICENSE.TERMS). This is a non-copyleft license ("X11") similar to the MIT license. I do not claim copyright on my changes. All code from version 1.6.3 and earlier retains the copyright of Martin C. Shepherd.
